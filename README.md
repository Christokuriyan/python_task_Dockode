I have completed this task to the best of my ability, but it doesn't exactly match the format you provided. I can create this pattern in Python using the Turtle graphics library, but I cannot use characters like "/" or "_" to create the design because we rely on the pen function for that purpose. Could you please provide me with the exact solution for this task? I am very curious to learn how to achieve it.
